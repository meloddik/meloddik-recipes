  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 large lemons (for juice and zest)</li>
    <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
    <li>4 large eggs</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <h3>Zest and Juice the Lemons</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Zest the lemons to get about 2 tablespoons of zest.</li>
    <li>Juice the lemons to yield approximately 1/2 to 3/4 cup of fresh lemon juice.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Whisk Eggs and Sugar</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>In a heatproof bowl, whisk together the eggs and sugar until well combined.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Add Lemon Zest and Juice</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Stir in the lemon zest and freshly squeezed lemon juice into the egg-sugar mixture.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Cook Over Medium Heat</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler) to create indirect heat.</li>
    <li>Add the butter to the mixture and continue stirring until the butter melts and the mixture thickens. This
      typically
      takes about 10-15 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Strain the Curd</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Once the curd has thickened and coats the back of a spoon, remove it from heat.</li>
    <li>Strain the curd through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any bits of zest or cooked egg.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Cool and Refrigerate</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Allow the lemon curd to cool to room temperature.</li>
    <li>Refrigerate the curd for at least 2 hours or until it's well-chilled.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Serve and Enjoy</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Use the lemon curd as a spread on toast, a filling for pastries, or a topping for desserts.</li>
  </ol>
